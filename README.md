# Wine_Quality_Project

Testing the quality classification tasks of red and white wine. A total of 1600 red wine data and nearly 5000 white wine data. Classify the quality of wine detection. Four models were trained: DNN, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest. The models were improved by comparing different models and using binary classification methods. The average accuracy was increased from 60% to 81%.
